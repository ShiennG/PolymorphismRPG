Hello, this is examplary code with polymorphism.
I've made just about enough to demonstrate my knowledge of the topic (inheritance, getters and setters), the code still could use some improvements like:
game loop, a few more skills, random encounter function, mob variations and leveling which are time consuming but easy to implement (I might add those later)
